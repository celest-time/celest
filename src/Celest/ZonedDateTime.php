/**
 * A date-time with a time-zone in the ISO-8601 calendar system,
 * such as {@code 2007-12-03T10:15:30+01:00 Europe/Paris}.
 * <p>
 * {@code ZonedDateTime} is an immutable representation of a date-time with a time-zone.
 * This class stores all date and time fields, to a precision of nanoseconds,
 * and a time-zone, with a zone offset used to handle ambiguous local date-times.
 * For example, the value
 * "2nd October 2007 at 13:45.30.123456789 +02:00 in the Europe/Paris time-zone"
 * can be stored in a {@code ZonedDateTime}.
 * <p>
 * This class handles conversion from the local time-line of {@code LocalDateTime}
 * to the instant time-line of {@code Instant}.
 * The difference between the two time-lines is the offset from UTC/Greenwich,
 * represented by a {@code ZoneOffset}.
 * <p>
 * Converting between the two time-lines involves calculating the offset using the
 * {@link ZoneRules rules} accessed from the {@code ZoneId}.
 * Obtaining the offset for an instant is simple, as there is exactly one valid
 * offset for each instant. By contrast, obtaining the offset for a local date-time
 * is not straightforward. There are three cases:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Normal, with one valid offset. For the vast majority of the year, the normal
 *  case applies, where there is a single valid offset for the local date-time.</li>
 * <li>Gap, with zero valid offsets. This is when clocks jump forward typically
 *  due to the spring daylight savings change from "winter" to "summer".
 *  In a gap there are local date-time values with no valid offset.</li>
 * <li>Overlap, with two valid offsets. This is when clocks are set back typically
 *  due to the autumn daylight savings change from "summer" to "winter".
 *  In an overlap there are local date-time values with two valid offsets.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Any method that converts directly or implicitly from a local date-time to an
 * instant by obtaining the offset has the potential to be complicated.
 * <p>
 * For Gaps, the general strategy is that if the local date-time falls in the
 * middle of a Gap, then the resulting zoned date-time will have a local date-time
 * shifted forwards by the length of the Gap, resulting in a date-time in the later
 * offset, typically "summer" time.
 * <p>
 * For Overlaps, the general strategy is that if the local date-time falls in the
 * middle of an Overlap, then the previous offset will be retained. If there is no
 * previous offset, or the previous offset is invalid, then the earlier offset is
 * used, typically "summer" time.. Two additional methods,
 * {@link #withEarlierOffsetAtOverlap()} and {@link #withLaterOffsetAtOverlap()},
 * help manage the case of an overlap.
 * <p>
 * In terms of design, this class should be viewed primarily as the combination
 * of a {@code LocalDateTime} and a {@code ZoneId}. The {@code ZoneOffset} is
 * a vital, but secondary, piece of information, used to ensure that the class
 * represents an instant, especially during a daylight savings overlap.
 *
 * <p>
 * This is a <a href="{@docRoot}/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html">value-based</a>
 * class; use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality
 * ({@code ==}), identity hash code, or synchronization) on instances of
 * {@code ZonedDateTime} may have unpredictable results and should be avoided.
 * The {@code equals} method should be used for comparisons.
 *
 * @implSpec
 * A {@code ZonedDateTime} holds state equivalent to three separate objects,
 * a {@code LocalDateTime}, a {@code ZoneId} and the resolved {@code ZoneOffset}.
 * The offset and local date-time are used to define an instant when necessary.
 * The zone ID is used to obtain the rules for how and when the offset changes.
 * The offset cannot be freely set, as the zone controls which offsets are valid.
 * <p>
 * This class is immutable and thread-safe.

     * <p>
     * A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
     * A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
     * A selection of common adjustments is provided in
     * {@link java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjusters TemporalAdjusters}.
     * These include finding the "last day of the month" and "next Wednesday".
     * Key date-time classes also implement the {@code TemporalAdjuster} interface,
     * such as {@link Month} and {@link java.time.MonthDay MonthDay}.
     * The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
     * lengths of month and leap years.
     * <p>
     * For example this code returns a date on the last day of July:
     * <pre>
     *  import static java.time.Month.*;
     *  import static java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjusters.*;
     *
     *  result = zonedDateTime.with(JULY).with(lastDayOfMonth());
     * </pre>
     * <p>
     * The classes {@link LocalDate} and {@link LocalTime} implement {@code TemporalAdjuster},
     * thus this method can be used to change the date, time or offset:
     * <pre>
     *  result = zonedDateTime.with(date);
     *  result = zonedDateTime.with(time);
     * </pre>
     * <p>
     * {@link ZoneOffset} also implements {@code TemporalAdjuster} however using it
     * as an argument typically has no effect. The offset of a {@code ZonedDateTime} is
     * controlled primarily by the time-zone. As such, changing the offset does not generally
     * make sense, because there is only one valid offset for the local date-time and zone.
     * If the zoned date-time is in a daylight savings overlap, then the offset is used
     * to switch between the two valid offsets. In all other cases, the offset is ignored.
     * <p>
     * The result of this method is obtained by invoking the
     * {@link TemporalAdjuster#adjustInto(Temporal)} method on the
     * specified adjuster passing {@code this} as the argument.
     * <p>
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

     * Calculates the amount of time until another date-time in terms of the specified unit.
     * <p>
     * This calculates the amount of time between two {@code ZonedDateTime}
     * objects in terms of a single {@code TemporalUnit}.
     * The start and end points are {@code this} and the specified date-time.
     * The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
     * For example, the amount in days between two date-times can be calculated
     * using {@code startDateTime.until(endDateTime, DAYS)}.
     * <p>
     * The {@code Temporal} passed to this method is converted to a
     * {@code ZonedDateTime} using {@link #from(TemporalAccessor)}.
     * If the time-zone differs between the two zoned date-times, the specified
     * end date-time is normalized to have the same zone as this date-time.
     * <p>
     * The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
     * complete units between the two date-times.
     * For example, the amount in months between 2012-06-15T00:00Z and 2012-08-14T23:59Z
     * will only be one month as it is one minute short of two months.
     * <p>
     * There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
     * The first is to invoke this method.
     * The second is to use {@link TemporalUnit#between(Temporal, Temporal)}:
     * <pre>
     *   // these two lines are equivalent
     *   amount = start.until(end, MONTHS);
     *   amount = MONTHS.between(start, end);
     * </pre>
     * The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.
     * <p>
     * The calculation is implemented in this method for {@link ChronoUnit}.
     * The units {@code NANOS}, {@code MICROS}, {@code MILLIS}, {@code SECONDS},
     * {@code MINUTES}, {@code HOURS} and {@code HALF_DAYS}, {@code DAYS},
     * {@code WEEKS}, {@code MONTHS}, {@code YEARS}, {@code DECADES},
     * {@code CENTURIES}, {@code MILLENNIA} and {@code ERAS} are supported.
     * Other {@code ChronoUnit} values will throw an exception.
     * <p>
     * The calculation for date and time units differ.
     * <p>
     * Date units operate on the local time-line, using the local date-time.
     * For example, the period from noon on day 1 to noon the following day
     * in days will always be counted as exactly one day, irrespective of whether
     * there was a daylight savings change or not.
     * <p>
     * Time units operate on the instant time-line.
     * The calculation effectively converts both zoned date-times to instants
     * and then calculates the period between the instants.
     * For example, the period from noon on day 1 to noon the following day
     * in hours may be 23, 24 or 25 hours (or some other amount) depending on
     * whether there was a daylight savings change or not.
     * <p>
     * If the unit is not a {@code ChronoUnit}, then the result of this method
     * is obtained by invoking {@code TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)}
     * passing {@code this} as the first argument and the converted input temporal
     * as the second argument.
     * <p>
     * This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
