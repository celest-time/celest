/**
 * A time-based amount of time, such as '34.5 seconds'.
 * <p>
 * This class models a quantity or amount of time in terms of seconds and nanoseconds.
 * It can be accessed using other duration-based units, such as minutes and hours.
 * In addition, the {@link ChronoUnit#DAYS DAYS} unit can be used and is treated as
 * exactly equal to 24 hours, thus ignoring daylight savings effects.
 * See {@link Period} for the date-based equivalent to this class.
 * <p>
 * A physical duration could be of infinite length.
 * For practicality, the duration is stored with constraints similar to {@link Instant}.
 * The duration uses nanosecond resolution with a maximum value of the seconds that can
 * be held in a {@code long}. This is greater than the current estimated age of the universe.
 * <p>
 * The range of a duration requires the storage of a number larger than a {@code long}.
 * To achieve this, the class stores a {@code long} representing seconds and an {@code int}
 * representing nanosecond-of-second, which will always be between 0 and 999,999,999.
 * The model is of a directed duration, meaning that the duration may be negative.
 * <p>
 * The duration is measured in "seconds", but these are not necessarily identical to
 * the scientific "SI second" definition based on atomic clocks.
 * This difference only impacts durations measured near a leap-second and should not affect
 * most applications.
 * See {@link Instant} for a discussion as to the meaning of the second and time-scales.
 *
 * <p>
 * This is a <a href="{@docRoot}/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html">value-based</a>
 * class; use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality
 * ({@code ==}), identity hash code, or synchronization) on instances of
 * {@code Duration} may have unpredictable results and should be avoided.
 * The {@code equals} method should be used for comparisons.
 *
 * @implSpec
 * This class is immutable and thread-safe.
