/**
 * A year-month in the ISO-8601 calendar system, such as {@code 2007-12}.
 * <p>
 * {@code YearMonth} is an immutable date-time object that represents the combination
 * of a year and month. Any field that can be derived from a year and month, such as
 * quarter-of-year, can be obtained.
 * <p>
 * This class does not store or represent a day, time or time-zone.
 * For example, the value "October 2007" can be stored in a {@code YearMonth}.
 * <p>
 * The ISO-8601 calendar system is the modern civil calendar system used today
 * in most of the world. It is equivalent to the proleptic Gregorian calendar
 * system, in which today's rules for leap years are applied for all time.
 * For most applications written today, the ISO-8601 rules are entirely suitable.
 * However, any application that makes use of historical dates, and requires them
 * to be accurate will find the ISO-8601 approach unsuitable.
 *
 * <p>
 * This is a <a href="{@docRoot}/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html">value-based</a>
 * class; use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality
 * ({@code ==}), identity hash code, or synchronization) on instances of
 * {@code YearMonth} may have unpredictable results and should be avoided.
 * The {@code equals} method should be used for comparisons.
 *
 * @implSpec
 * This class is immutable and thread-safe.
