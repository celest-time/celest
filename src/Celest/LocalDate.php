/**
 * A date without a time-zone in the ISO-8601 calendar system,
 * such as {@code 2007-12-03}.
 * <p>
 * {@code LocalDate} is an immutable date-time object that represents a date,
 * often viewed as year-month-day. Other date fields, such as day-of-year,
 * day-of-week and week-of-year, can also be accessed.
 * For example, the value "2nd October 2007" can be stored in a {@code LocalDate}.
 * <p>
 * This class does not store or represent a time or time-zone.
 * Instead, it is a description of the date, as used for birthdays.
 * It cannot represent an instant on the time-line without additional information
 * such as an offset or time-zone.
 * <p>
 * The ISO-8601 calendar system is the modern civil calendar system used today
 * in most of the world. It is equivalent to the proleptic Gregorian calendar
 * system, in which today's rules for leap years are applied for all time.
 * For most applications written today, the ISO-8601 rules are entirely suitable.
 * However, any application that makes use of historical dates, and requires them
 * to be accurate will find the ISO-8601 approach unsuitable.
 *
 * <p>
 * This is a <a href="{@docRoot}/java/lang/doc-files/ValueBased.html">value-based</a>
 * class; use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality
 * ({@code ==}), identity hash code, or synchronization) on instances of
 * {@code LocalDate} may have unpredictable results and should be avoided.
 * The {@code equals} method should be used for comparisons.
 *
 * @implSpec
 * This class is immutable and thread-safe.
 *
 * @since 1.8
